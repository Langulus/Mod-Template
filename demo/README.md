<p>Show what your module can do!</p>
<p>A demo isn't really necessary, but it provides you with a framework to test more user interaction related things.
<p>If your tests are guaranteed to always halt, move them instead to the mandatory `test` folder, so they can be consistently tested.
<p>You can safely discard this entire directory (and the associated CMake snippets) if you have no need for demos.
<p>Otherwise, all you need to modify is `Demo.cpp` with your demo setup.
